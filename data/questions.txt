1) Probelinks:
   What is the difference between the probelinks files (U133a, U133b,...)?
   Where are they downloaded from? I like to write a guideline on how to get them.

2) Links:
    Links are translated to their respective probe UDP.
  - We assume that each link can be mapped to multiple probes (although each probe can be mapped to one link only).
    Is that a valid assumption?
  - How to handle links that cannot be found in the probelinks file?
    They will get np.NaN for UDP value so that we can remove them later from complex and path calculation.
    Matlab ignores (removes) interactions that have missing values from activity and consistency calculation.
  - We take the maximum UDP for all probes of a link to represent the link UDP (this is how Matlab seems to do it).
    Is that correct? I suggest taking the maximum less than 1 in order to handle non-existing probes.

3) Complexes:
   - For complex of type protein, its UDP is taken as the maximum of its Links UDP. It seems that Matlab is doing that as well.
     Is that the right calculation?
   - RNA complexes never have links, hence no UDP is associated with them. I assign UDP=1 (so they don't affect any
     calculation they are involved in).
   - I call complexes that have only proteins/compounds/rna (i.e. no 'sub'-complexes) - 'basic complexes'.
     How to handle basic-complexes that don't have any proteins attached to them in the complex file?
     I assign them a UDP=np.NaN and remove them from later calculations both for complexes and paths.
   - How to handle complexes numbers that cannot be found in complex file (during activity and consistency calculation)?
     During activity and consistency we only keep complexes with valid UDP value. We removed all NaN earlier.
   - Some proteins in the complex file don't have links. In that case they will get the default UDP value of np.NaN

4) Paths:
   - Some paths have only inputs, so we remove them from the results.
   (The paper suggest leaving them, but with no consistency meaning).
